# InfinityLoop
InfinityLoop is a homepage for me where you can play original games, experiments, and more made by me.
My old sites were InfinityLoopGames and InfinityLoopHome, but I combined them into one site.

# Site Link
The site for InfinityLoop is
https://infinityloop1.netlify.app

# Games & Experiments
All the games and experiments on this site I have created myself. Some are also hosted on my <a href=https://infinityloopgames.itch.io>itch.io</a>.
There will be a link to play it in this site and on my itch.io, depending on which sites they're on.

# Games & Experiments Code Rules
Please do not take the html files of games to put on your own sites or for personal use, they are my property, I made them.

# Website Code
This website was made in HTML and CSS. 
The code amount counter in GitHub says it is only made of HTML, this is because it is messed up because my games are very large HTML files. The files are too large that even GitHub can't display it, it has to be downloaded raw. They are actually made in other game making platforms and then packaged into HTML.
