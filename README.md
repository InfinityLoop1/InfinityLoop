# Games & Experiments
All the games and experiments on this site I have created myself. Some are also hosted on my <a href=https://infinityloopgames.itch.io>itch.io</a>.
There will be a link to play it in this site and on my itch.io, depending on which sites they're on.
All code for my games is put onto a private repository. This is so people cannot take the code files for my games and put it on their own sites or claim it as their own.
