# InfinityLoop
InfinityLoop is a homepage for me where you can play original games, experiments, and more made by me.
My old sites were InfinityLoopGames and InfinityLoopHome, but I combined them into one site.

# Site Link
The site for InfinityLoop is
https://infinityloop1.netlify.app

# Games & Experiments
All the games and experiments on this site I have created myself. Some are also hosted on my <a href=https://infinityloopgames.itch.io>itch.io</a>.
There will be a link to play it in this site and on my itch.io, depending on which sites they're on.
All code for my games is put onto a private repository, so people cannot take my games and claim it as their own.

# Website Code
This part of the website is open-source, so code rules for this repository follows the MIT License.
