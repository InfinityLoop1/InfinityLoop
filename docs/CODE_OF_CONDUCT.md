# Collaborator Rules

If you were invited to be a collaborator on this project, I have given you a lot of trust. This is the rules I expect you to follow if you are a collaborator.

- Rule 1: You are not allowed to edit code in any such way that it is harmful to the site.
- Rule 2: You are not allowed to edit code in any such way that it changes the site in an unwanted way.
- Rule 3: You are not allowed to change repository descriptions, READMEs, Code of Conducts, Contributing guidlines, Licenses, Security Policies, or anything that will change the repository's details.
- Rule 4: You are not allowed to make excessive, frequent commits. After committing, you must wait at least 10 seconds before committing again. Committing too fast will create concurrent builds, which my Netlify free plan does not allow for.
- Rule 5: Do not upload big files. I cannot use too much bandwidth. Please limit files to 50MB. If you need to add a bigger file, please consult me first.

# Pull Request Rules

- Rule 4: You are not allowed to change repository descriptions, READMEs, Code of Conducts, Contributing guidlines, Licenses, Security Policies, or anything that will change the repository's details.
- Rule 5: Do not increase the repository's file size by too much. I cannot use too much bandwidth. Please limit changes to +100MB.
